							<h1>Discussion</h1>
							<p>
								We started to go over a few papers which were selected as potentially interesting. <br />
								The LPWAN paper has a few interesting parts in the paper (but not everything is usable for our subject)
								General feedback is to try searching with keywords/subtopics instead of looking at cites, additionally try to find one or two very good paper on identity management which is propably going to be one of the subtopics.
								Try to find 5-8 subtopics on management, then rewrite/add more inclusion/exclusion criteria aimed at your management subtopics. Finally check which studies can be used/discarded based on the criteria.
							</p>
							<h3>Questions:</h3>
							<h4>Some papers are technical and very specific on a certain subject, to what degree are these usable for my literature study and should I include them</h4>
							<p>
								<i>
									It's possible that a certain 'specific' study is applicable for your literature study. However the paper should be generic enough to also apply on a more generic situation. <br />
									Looking at the current selection of studies, we see that there are alot of surveys, you do not want to end up with a literature study on only surveys, here more specific papers are interesting.
								</i>
							</p>
							<h4>'Management' in the general sense is a broad topic, should I narrow the scope? </h4>
							<p>
								<i>
									Yes we agree that management can include many different topics. You should narrow it down to 5-8 subtopics. We are mostly interested in:
									<ul>
										<li>Update management</li>
										<li>Modifying/managing functionality</li>
										<li>Performance</li>
										<li>Points of above in regards to frequency of updates (classification criteria?)</li>
									</ul>
								</i>
							</p>
							<h3>To do:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Find & write down 5-8 subtopics.</li>
								<li>Add more inclusion / exclusion criteria where the subtopics are the base of the new criteria.</li>
								<li>Find more literature, input subtopics and keywords</li>
								<li>Scan if papers meets criteria</li>
								<li>Optional: add a weight to certain criteria[?]</li>

								<li>Studie proposes a solution for a certain IoT system management problem, or describes an IoT system management problem.</li>
								<li>The paper is from a reputable source, the paper is frequently cited or is published by a institute of 'undisputed reputation'.</li>
								<li>The paper has to be properly written. (Think grammar / spelling) [?]</li>
								<li>A study that is written in English</li>
								<li>A study that is peer reviewed [?]</li>
								<li>[Needs expanding....]</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Exclusion criteria:</h4>

								<li>Read headers</li>
								<li>Scan conclusion / Future work / similar studies if present</li>
								<li>Write down potential interesting parts</li>
								<li>Has to be done within 5-10 mins.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Questions for meeting:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>'Management' can be very broad, should we narrow it down?</li>
								<li>Should I include very technical papers, for instance papers who present protocols with technical details?</li>

							<b>Feedback - 26/11/2020</b>
						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							Looking at paper: 'Sensor network software update management: a survey'. Seems a good start, however the paper from 2005 which is 15 years old. <br />
							Ask yourself:
							<ul>
								<li>Which papers have referred to this paper, and in which way?</li>
								<li>Which technological advancements have impacted the chosen research topics. Think network capabilities and increased processing speed. It could also be the case that the paper is not affected.</li>
								<li>Are there other important considerations?</li>

							<p>
								We are looking for something in the field of deployment and/or management of IoT Devices.
								More specifically:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Which solutions are being used to manage IoT Devices?</li>
								<li>Which solution is effective in which IoT environment?</li>
								<li>Can we create a 'classification' of solutions as a point of reference for future implementations</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Other questions:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Which common IoT platforms are there?</li>
								<li>Which management/update/deployment tools exist?</li>
								<li>Can we get inspiration from other research fields? (for example: methods of software updates for normal devices)</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Discussion</h5>
							<p>
								There are many different IoT systems. There are many different factors to consider different IoT systems have different constraints. 
								IoT Constraints can be: energy/power, connection constraints (small bandwidth), security. We also have physical constraints
								like for example: location (geographically) and weather. Naturally we can have a combination of constraints in a single IoT system.
							</p>

								<b>How to tackle the literature study?</b><br />
								<i>
									Try to find research on google scholar, papers which are cited (alot) generally have more 'prestige' and are considered a 'better' source.
									Beware of papers behind a 'paywall'. You can send the authors an e-mail and request the paper or use google to find a draft version of the paper.
								</i>
								<i>
									When you've found a paper, do not read it in-depth yet. To decide if the paper is 'good': read the abstract and conclusions. 
									Try to look for the 'added value' of the paper, the contribution of the paper to the research community. Ask yourself the question 'what is new?'.
									A good paper has a related work section, usually chapter 2 or at the end of the paper you can find a related work section. This is another indication.
									Finally if the paper is published by a notable institute (think MIT) you are usually dealing with a good research paper.

								<b>Are there any tools I should use?</b> <br />
								<i>You can use <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a> or <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a>, but it can be overkill. Otherwise Google Docs to share the papers.</i>
							</p>
							<h5>
								To do:
							</h5>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1selOKckS0SOmpo_mm4JoFezWE1erdHnX/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check powerpoint slides by Patricia Lago</a></li>
								<li>Go on Google Scholar - Try to find research, make a list of say 20 papers</li>
								<li>Next meeting 04/12/2020 13:00</li>
